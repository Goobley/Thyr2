# Thyr

More complete documentation to follow, though the public API is already documented in the `doc` folder.
Running Thyr:
- Modify `compile.sh` to work with your environment
- Run `compile.sh`
- Clone [Plyght](https://github.com/Goobley/Plyght) into the folder where Thyr is cloned
- Inspect and/or modify the `ThyrDriver.lua` file (should be well commented)
- Run Plyght (i.e. `python3 Plyght/plyght.py`)
- Run the simulation `luajit ThyrDriver.lua`
